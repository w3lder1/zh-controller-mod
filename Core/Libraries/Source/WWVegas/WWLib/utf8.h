// UTF-8 <-> wide-character transcoding, hand-rolled per RFC 3629, using no platform text APIs.

// code unit (astral codepoints use surrogate pairs); on most other platforms it is a 32-bit
// UTF-32 codepoint. Both are handled transparently based on the width of wchar_t.

// Returned by the decoding functions when the source is not well-formed UTF-8. A return of 0 means
// an empty result, which is a success and must not be confused with a decoding failure.
